I am a PhD student in the UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Environmental Intelligence.

# Current Research
My PhD research concerns ancient ecosystems and the feedbacks between their biotic and abiotic components which have driven the long-term evolution of the Earth system. I use biogeochemical models of the ocean and atmosphere in combination with ecophysiological modeling of past organisms and ecological community dynamics to consider how life has shaped the Earth system and how that holistic system can be stabilized or destabilized.

# Past Research
